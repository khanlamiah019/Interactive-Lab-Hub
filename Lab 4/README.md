### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 3 ways you can do so:


Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.
```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2026
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

Option 3: (preferred) use the Github.com interface to update the changes.

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We connected the MPR121 capacitive sensor to the Raspberry Pi using a Qwiic connection. We attached two conductive objects to touch pads 6 and 10 using alligator clips. When we touched either object, the Python program detected the change in capacitance and printed Pad 6 touched! or Pad 10 touched! in the terminal. This showed how ordinary objects can be used as touch-sensitive controls. We have attached image of terminal and physical setup below:

### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We connected the APDS-9960 sensor to the Raspberry Pi using a Qwiic connector. We ran proximity_test.py to measure how close an object was, gesture_test.py to detect hand movements such as up, down, left, and right, and color_test.py to read RGB and ambient light values. We attached screenshots of the terminal outputs and photos of the physical sensor setup.

<summary><strong>Rotary Encoder lab instructions</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

#### Rotary Encoder 

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came pre-soldered, so you do NOT need to solder anything.

</p>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script, it comes with an additional button which might be useful for your design!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python encoder_test.py
```

You can go to the [Adafruit Learn Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder/python-circuitpython) to learn more about the sensor! The sensor actually comes with an LED (neo pixel): Can you try lighting it up? 

</details>

#### Joystick 

We connected the SparkFun Qwiic Joystick to the Raspberry Pi using a Qwiic connector. We ran `joystick_test.py` to observe the joystick’s horizontal and vertical movement, pivot direction, and built-in button press. We attached screenshots of the terminal output and photos of the physical setup. We also included the `joystick_test.py` file and the SparkFun GitHub reference for the sensor.

#### Distance Sensor

We connected the SparkFun VCNL4040 proximity sensor to the Raspberry Pi using a Qwiic connector. We ran `qwiic_distance.py` to measure the distance between the sensor and nearby objects. The sensor can detect objects from close range up to approximately 20 cm. We attached screenshots of the terminal output and photos of the physical setup. We also included the `qwiic_distance.py` file and the SparkFun GitHub reference.

### Part C
### Servo Actuation
We connected the SparkFun Servo pHAT to the Raspberry Pi and attached a 9g micro servo to channel 0. The Servo pHAT was powered separately through its USB-C connection so the servo received enough current without using the Raspberry Pi’s 5 V rail. We ran pi_servo_hat_test.py to sweep the servo between different angles and observe its movement. We attached screenshots of the terminal output and photos of the physical setup,

### Part D
### Physical Interaction Design: Feast Automata

<details>
<summary><strong>Part D instructions</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

**Feast Automata:** build a device that **transforms ordinary dining rituals into playful physical interactions.** Begin with a familiar experience around eating, drinking, cooking, serving, or sharing food, and explore how sensing and actuation might augment, exaggerate, automate, or reinterpret your dining experience.

In this part, use the sensing techniques from Parts A–B and the servo actuation from Part C to develop a physical interaction.

#### Physical considerations for sensing

Sensors need to be positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for an application. Choose a sensor that fits the dining interaction you want to explore. For example, a distance sensor could detect when a cup is placed on a coaster; where the sensor is positioned determines what it can reliably detect.

Think about how the larger object needs to be shaped so the sensor can work reliably, where the actuator needs to sit, what moves, and how a person encounters the interaction.

#### Physical Form and Housing

Think about how your sensor, actuator, and electronics are physically arranged within your prototype. Consider where components need to be placed, what parts move, how the device is supported or enclosed, and how the overall form and aesthetics shape the interaction.

Use cardboard, paper, found objects, or other low-fidelity materials to quickly prototype the physical structure before refining your final design.

#### Optional Display Feedback: Qwiic OLED

Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibly mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

</p>


As you develop your Feast Automata concept, consider where the sensor and actuator need to be placed, what parts move, how electronics are housed, and how the overall form and aesthetics support the interaction.

*Prototype:* Test rear cable routing and check for visual clutter or cable tension.
- Debugging Access: Can the Raspberry Pi be accessed without damaging the housing?  
*Prototype:* Test a removable back panel using magnets, tabs, or Velcro.

### Concept Development
#### **Design Selection**

We chose the Daruma Chef concept because we wanted to create a friendly, character-like robot that communicates through movement. We adapted the design into a chef character with a simple, rounded body and a chef hat to give it a recognizable personality. The neck-pivot mechanism allows the head to tilt forward in a bowing gesture, while sensors enable the robot to respond to user interactions. We chose this concept because it combines expressive movement with a compact design that can house the necessary electronics.

#### **Prototype Documentation**

We built a low-fidelity paper and cardboard prototype to explore the chef’s shape, proportions, and neck-pivot movement. The prototype illustrates how the head could tilt forward to create a bowing gesture while the base remains stationary. We also explored potential placements for the servo, sensors, Raspberry Pi, and speaker within the body. The final design may need to be larger to accommodate the Raspberry Pi and speaker comfortably, while leaving enough room for the wiring and moving mechanism. This early model helped us visualize the physical arrangement and identify adjustments to make before building the functional prototype.

#### Our System

**Code**

- [`bown_appetit.py`](bown_appetit.py): main program (sensing + bow + greeting)
- [`bow_voice_test.py`](bow_voice_test.py): test script for tuning the voice and bow timing

**Interaction Flow**

<img width="1374" height="538" alt="Interaction flow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750c8809-49f6-49a3-a0ac-437f6603d2fb" />

**Our Reflection**

Building Bown Appétit taught us that sensing, movement, and physical form cannot be designed separately. Our first paper model focused on the chef’s shape and proportions, but it did not fully account for the hardware. Once the circuit was wired, we had to resize the body to a more practical scale that could hold the Raspberry Pi, the speaker, and the wiring while leaving room for the neck pivot to move. Sensing also shaped the form in return. Because the sensor needed to detect chopsticks resting on the table, it had to sit low, at chopstick height. We first planned a pocket at the front of the body, but in the final build we moved the APDS-9960 to the side. This kept the front of the character clean and complete, and it matched where people naturally rest their chopsticks, beside the plate rather than in front of it.

Choosing and tuning the sensor was harder than we expected. Gesture detection did not fit our interaction, because picking up chopsticks is not a clear, consistent hand gesture like a swipe up or down. Color readings shifted with different light sources and gave us only RGB values, which made confident decisions difficult. We ended up combining proximity with ambient light and sorting each reading into present, absent, or uncertain. A hand or a sleeve passing by produces an uncertain reading and resets the timer, and a 0.6-second debounce keeps those moments from triggering a false bow. We also tuned the bow over many iterations so the servo moves smoothly from 45° to 90° in 1° steps instead of snapping into place.

What surprised us most was how much the timing between sound and motion shaped the character. Instead of firing them at the same instant, we let the greeting start first and begin the bow half a second later, then hold the bow briefly after the voice ends before returning upright. This sequence feels closer to how a person speaks and then bows, and it makes the robot read as polite rather than mechanical. 



<details>
<summary><strong>Part E instructions, Windmill Coaster example & optional extensions</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

**Your prototype should:**
- Use at least one sensing or input device.
- Use servo-based physical actuation.
- Connect sensing and actuation into a meaningful interaction around eating, drinking, cooking, serving, or sharing food.
- Additional inputs, displays, LEDs, buttons, or other outputs are optional extensions.

**Document your system with:**
- Code for your sensing + actuation prototype
- Photos and/or video of the working prototype in action
- A simple interaction diagram or sketch showing how sensing and actuation are connected
- Written reflection: What did you learn about connecting sensing, movement, and physical form? What was fun, surprising, or challenging?

**Questions to consider:**
- How does your chosen sensor or input shape the physical response?
- How does the physical arrangement of the sensor and actuator change the interaction?
- What thresholds, timing, or movement patterns make the interaction feel clear or playful?
- What changes when you adjust the sensor placement or servo motion?

Iterate on the sensing, movement, and physical form, and document what you discover.

See encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py in the Lab 4 folder for an optional example of chaining together three devices.

**`Lab 4/encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py`**

#### Example Application: Windmill Coaster

Now that you have explored both sensing and actuation, here is a simple example that combines the two.

The **Windmill Coaster** uses a Qwiic distance/proximity sensor to detect when a cup is placed on a coaster. When the cup is detected, a servo motor animates a small windmill by sweeping it back and forth, turning an ordinary action during drinking into a playful physical interaction.

<p align="center">
    <img src="windmill_coaster11.gif" alt="Windmill Coaster Demo" width="400"/>
</p>


This example demonstrates a simple interaction pipeline:

**cup placed → distance sensor detects cup → servo actuates windmill**

Connect the Qwiic distance sensor to the Pi and connect the servo to Channel 0 of the Servo pHAT. Make sure the Servo pHAT is powered through its USB-C connection.

Run the example script:

```bash
python windmill_coaster.py
```

The script continuously reads the proximity value from the distance sensor. When the value passes a threshold, the servo begins animating the windmill. When the cup is removed, the servo stops and returns to its resting position.

You may need to adjust `CUP_THRESHOLD` in [`windmill_coaster.py`](windmill_coaster.py) depending on the size of your cup and the physical placement of the sensor. You can run `qwiic_distance.py` first to compare readings with and without a cup.

Use this example as a starting point. Change the sensor, movement, physical form, or dining interaction to create your own Feast Automata variation.

#### Optional Extensions

The following examples are optional resources if you want to add more inputs or outputs to your prototype.

##### Using Multiple Qwiic Buttons: Changing I2C Address (Physically & Digitally)

If you want to use more than one Qwiic Button in your project, you must give each button a unique I2C address. There are two ways to do this:

##### 1. Physically: Soldering Address Jumpers

On the back of the Qwiic Button, you'll find four solder jumpers labeled A0, A1, A2, and A3. By bridging these with solder, you change the I2C address. Only one button on the chain can use the default address (0x6F).

**Address Table:**

| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | Address (hex) |
|----|----|----|----|---------------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x6F       |
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |    0x6E       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |    0x6D       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |    0x6C       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |    0x6B       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |    0x6A       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |    0x69       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |    0x68       |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x67       |
| ...| ...| ...| ... |     ...      |

For example, if you solder A0 closed (leave A1, A2, A3 open), the address becomes 0x6E.

**Soldering Tips:**
- Use a small amount of solder to bridge the pads for the jumper you want to close.
- Only one jumper needs to be closed for each address change (see table above).
- Power cycle the button after changing the jumper.

##### 2. Digitally: Using Software to Change Address

You can also change the address in software (temporarily or permanently) using the example script `qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py` in the Lab 4 folder. This is useful if you want to reassign addresses without soldering.

Run the script and follow the prompts:
```bash
python qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py
```
Enter the new address (e.g., 5B for 0x5B) when prompted. Power cycle the button after changing the address.

**Note:** The software method is less foolproof and you need to make sure to keep track of which button has which address!


##### Using Multiple Buttons in Code

After setting unique addresses, you can use multiple buttons in your script. See these example scripts in the Lab 4 folder:

- **`qwiic_1_button.py`**: Basic example for reading a single Qwiic Button (default address 0x6F). Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_1_button.py
	```

- **`qwiic_button_led_demo.py`**: Demonstrates using two Qwiic Buttons at different addresses (e.g., 0x6F and 0x6E) and controlling their LEDs. Button 1 toggles its own LED; Button 2 toggles both LEDs. Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_button_led_demo.py
	```

Here is a minimal code example for two buttons:
```python
import qwiic_button

# Default button (0x6F)
button1 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton()
# Button with A0 soldered (0x6E)
button2 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton(0x6E)

button1.begin()
button2.begin()

while True:
		if button1.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 1 pressed!")
		if button2.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 2 pressed!")
```

##### PCF8574 GPIO Expander: Add More Pins Over I²C

Sometimes your Pi’s header GPIO pins are already full (e.g., with a display or HAT). That’s where an I²C GPIO expander comes in handy.

We use the Adafruit PCF8574 I²C GPIO Expander, which gives you 8 extra digital pins over I²C. It’s a great way to prototype with LEDs, buttons, or other components on the breadboard without worrying about pin conflicts—similar to how Arduino users often expand their pinouts when prototyping physical interactions.

**Why is this useful?**
- You only need two wires (I²C: SDA + SCL) to unlock 8 extra GPIOs.
- It integrates smoothly with CircuitPython and Blinka.
- It allows a clean prototyping workflow when the Pi’s 40-pin header is already occupied by displays, HATs, or sensors.
- Makes breadboard setups feel more like an Arduino-style prototyping environment where it’s easy to wire up interaction elements.

**Demo Script:** `Lab 4/gpio_expander.py`

<p align="center">
    <img src="gpio_leds.gif" alt="GPIO Expander LED Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

We connected 8 LEDs (through 220 Ω resistors) to the expander and ran a little light show. The script cycles through three patterns:
- Chase (one LED at a time, left to right)
- Knight Rider (back-and-forth sweep)
- Disco (random blink chaos)

Every few runs, the script swaps to the next pattern automatically:
```bash
python gpio_expander.py
```

This is a playful way to visualize how the expander works, but the same technique applies if you wanted to prototype buttons, switches, or other interaction elements. It’s a lightweight, flexible addition to your prototyping toolkit.

### Part F

### Final Documentation

<details>
<summary><strong>Part F instructions</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

Document all the prototypes and iterations you have designed and worked on! Again, deliverables for this lab are writings, sketches, photos, and videos that show what your prototype:
* "Looks like": shows how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
* "Works like": shows what the device can do
* "Acts like": shows how a person would interact with the device

</details>

### Looks Like
<img width="1200" height="1600" alt="image000001" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3500bf9e-6139-4284-a692-ac432d1ed114" />

- A small figure approximately 15 cm tall, built from cardboard and hand-drawn with markers. It has three parts: a white cylindrical chef's hat, a cube-shaped head with hand-drawn round glasses and a smiling mouth, and a larger body drawn as a purple shirt with a collar, buttons, and a pocket.
- A 9 g micro servo sits at the neck with a hinge, so the head and hat tilt forward together in a bowing gesture while the body stays still.
- The Raspberry Pi, Servo pHAT, and speaker are housed inside the body. The APDS-9960 sensor is mounted on the side of the body at chopstick height, facing the chopsticks that rest beside the figure, which keeps the front of the character clean.

### Works Like

<img width="1924" height="984" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d37b36c-7e85-471e-bd0e-e141813a1051" />
<img width="1200" height="1600" alt="image000000" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04421fe5-fbfc-4741-9126-82f2185aeaf5" />

- The APDS9960 continuously reads proximity and ambient light values to detect whether chopsticks are resting in their holder. The system classifies each reading as `present`, `absent`, or `uncertain`, using a 0.6-second debounce period to prevent false triggers from passing hands or clothing.
- Once the chopsticks are picked up and their absence is confirmed, the Raspberry Pi plays `ittadakimasu.mp3` in a background thread. Half a second after the greeting begins, the servo smoothly moves from 45° (upright) to 90° (bowed) in 1° increments.
- After the audio finishes and a brief pause, the servo returns to its upright position. The system then waits for the chopsticks to be returned before resetting, ensuring one bow per meal rather than repeated movements.

### Acts Like
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b82d609-d26f-45f0-b622-1e38813c8d34

- The interaction is entirely touch-free and rooted in ritual. The user simply picks up their chopsticks to begin eating, and Bown Appétit responds like a tiny dining companion, acknowledging the Japanese custom of saying *itadakimasu* before a meal.
- It is designed to feel polite and patient. The device waits until it detects the chopsticks in their holder, then responds only when they are removed. This makes the interaction feel intentional rather than reactive to every movement around the table.
- Returning the chopsticks quietly resets the device without another sound or gesture. Bown Appétit is present when the moment calls for it and unobtrusive the rest of the time.
