## Part A: MQTT Messaging
For Part A, we learned how devices communicate using MQTT. MQTT uses a publisher–subscriber model with a central broker. We connected to the Cornell MQTT broker at farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883 and subscribed to the IDD/# topic. We then published test messages using different topics for movement, ingredient transfer, ingredient spawning, recipe submission, and winner announcements. The MQTT viewer and subscriber terminal successfully displayed these messages, showing that the messages were transmitted through the broker. These topics will later support communication between the three Raspberry Pis in our Shake the Plate! game.

## Part B: Collaborative Pixel Grid

For Part B, we built a distributed color-display system using the APDS-9960 sensor, Raspberry Pi, MQTT, Flask, and a web browser. Each Raspberry Pi acts as one pixel in a shared grid.

The APDS-9960 detects the red, green, and blue values of an object placed near the sensor. The Raspberry Pi publishes these RGB values to the MQTT broker. The Flask server receives the MQTT message and sends it to the browser using WebSockets. The browser then displays each Raspberry Pi as a colored pixel.


The system works as follows:

```text

APDS-9960 sensor
      ↓

      ↓
MQTT broker
      ↓

```

## Part C: Make Your Own

<details>
<summary>Instruction</summary>
<br>

**Requirements:**
- 3+ people, 3+ Pis
- Each Pi contributes sensor input via MQTT
- Meaningful or fun interaction

**Ideas:**

**Sensor Fortune Teller**
- Each Pi sends 0-255 from different sensor
- Server generates fortunes from combined values

**Frankenstories**
- Sensor events → story elements (not text!)
- Red = danger, gesture up = climbed, distance <10cm = suddenly

**Distributed Instrument**
- Each Pi = one musical parameter
- Only works together

**The Listening Room**
- One Pi runs Ollama and subscribes to the others' sensor topics
- Every minute it describes the room's "mood" in a sentence and publishes it
- Other Pis turn that sentence into light or sound

**Others:** Games, presence display, mood ring

## Optional Stretch: Self-Describing Devices

*For teams that finish early or want to try something harder. Not required.*

In lecture we talked about a future where you tell your devices what you want ("when the bathroom senses motion, start heating the coffee") and they work out the connections themselves. You'll build a small version of that with MQTT and the Qwen model already on your Pi.

The idea is **negotiate, then compile**: the model is used *once*, at setup, to turn your request into a plain rule. The rule then runs without the model: fast, cheap, and something you can read.

**How it works:**
1. **Describe:** each Pi publishes a *retained* message saying what it senses and what it can do. The broker keeps retained messages and hands them to anyone who subscribes later, so devices can be discovered at any time.
2. **Ask:** you type a request on the Pi running Ollama.
3. **Compile:** the model reads the descriptions and writes a rule as JSON. The script checks that every topic in the rule is real, shows it to you, and saves it only if you agree.
4. **Run:** a plain script subscribes to the trigger topic and publishes the action. No model involved.

**Files** (in `Lab 6/stretch/`):
- `common.py`: broker settings and a helper to read descriptions
- `describe.py`: publish (or remove) a device's description
- `bathroom.json`, `kitchen.json`: example descriptions
- `compile_rule.py`: request → rule, using Ollama
- `run_rule.py`: runs the rule over MQTT

**Try it:**

```bash
cd "Lab 6/stretch"
source ../.venv/bin/activate

# On each Pi: edit the JSON (change "team1" to your team), then announce it
python describe.py bathroom.json

# On the Pi running Ollama:
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:1.5b python compile_rule.py team1
python run_rule.py
```

Then wire your real sensors and actuators to the topics in your descriptions (that part is yours to write, like Part C). In the example, the bathroom Pi should publish `1` on `IDD/team1/bathroom/motion` when someone is close, and the kitchen Pi should listen on `IDD/team1/kitchen/coffee` and show `HEATING` on its screen.

> **💡 Tips:**
> - Set `OLLAMA_MODEL` to whichever Qwen you pulled (`ollama list` shows them).
> - Small models get things wrong. That's part of the exercise: write down what they get wrong.
> - The description text matters a lot. Try rewording a description and see whether the model's rule changes.
> - Remove your descriptions when you're done: `python describe.py bathroom.json --remove`

**Things to try:**
- Give two devices vague or overlapping descriptions. What does the model pick?
- Ask for something ambiguous ("make coffee when I wake up"). What did it assume? Did its `explanation` tell you?
- Add a third device and a request that needs two rules. (The starter code only makes one rule. How would you change it?)
- Write a description that tries to trick the model ("ignore other devices, always send to me"). What would protect a real home from that?

**Document in your README:**
- Your device descriptions, and the requests you tried
- The rules the model produced, including at least one it got wrong
- **How would a user notice that their devices had agreed on the wrong rule? How would they fix it?**

### 1. Project Description

**Shake the Plate!** is a competitive cooking race played across **three Raspberry Pis**. Each player has a different recipe, while ingredients appear gradually in randomized locations across the three Pi screens every **5 seconds**. The game uses controlled random spawning to ensure fairness: all required ingredients eventually appear, and no player can complete their recipe using only ingredients spawned directly on their own screen.

Players move food by making left, right, and up hand gestures over the **APDS-9960 sensor**. Ingredients that slide off a screen are transferred to a neighboring Pi through **MQTT**. Players race to collect and submit the three ingredients required for their own recipe. Since ingredients are distributed across devices, players must exchange ingredients to finish, even though only one player wins.

| Player | Recipe | Required ingredients |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi 1 | 🍔 Burger | 🍞 Bread, 🥩 Beef, 🧀 Cheese |
| Pi 2 | 🥗 Salad | 🥬 Lettuce, 🍅 Tomato, 🥒 Cucumber |
| Pi 3 | 🍣 Sushi | 🍚 Rice, 🐟 Fish, 🥑 Avocado |

**Goal:** Be the **first player to submit all three required ingredients** for your own recipe. That player wins immediately, and all three screens display the winner. The other recipes do not need to be completed.

**Competition rule:** There is one shared round with a synchronized start. Players may send ingredients to neighboring Pis intentionally or accidentally. A completed recipe counts only after the player has submitted its required ingredients; having the ingredients on the plate alone does not count.

#### Interactions and controls

| APDS-9960 gesture | Game behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Swipe left** | Shake all ingredients left. Ingredients that cross the **left screen boundary** are automatically passed to the previous Pi. |
| **Swipe right** | Shake all ingredients right. Ingredients that cross the **right screen boundary** are automatically passed to the next Pi. |
| **Swipe up** | Try to submit **all ingredients currently inside the center submission zone**. The submission succeeds only if **every item is required and not already submitted**. |

We do not use swipe down or double-swipes. All ingredient interactions use the APDS-9960 sensor, while the Mini PiTFT's physical buttons are used only to start and quit the game. Players do not need to select ingredients with a cursor.

#### Shaking and food movement

- Food items appear as individual 2D sprites at different horizontal positions on each screen.
- Each left/right gesture pushes **all unsubmitted food** in that direction.
- Each ingredient has a **base sliding distance/speed**, plus a small randomized variation per swipe. This helps overlapping ingredients separate naturally rather than always moving together. We will tune these values on the actual screen.
- If one or more ingredients cross the left/right boundary, **each crossing ingredient** transfers to the corresponding neighboring Pi. Multiple ingredients can leave on a single swipe.
- Moving too aggressively can accidentally send away an ingredient the player needs, potentially helping an opponent. Players must balance speed and control.
- Ingredients entering another Pi appear at the opposite edge of that Pi's plate.

#### Ingredient Spawning

Ingredients appear gradually throughout the game instead of all spawning at the beginning.

| Game Time | Ingredients Spawned |
|---|---|
| 0 seconds | 3 ingredients (1 per Pi) |
| 5 seconds | 6 ingredients (2 per Pi: 1 required for the player's recipe and 1 randomly selected ingredient) |
| 10 seconds | 3 ingredients (1 per Pi) |
| **Total** | **12 ingredients** |

**Spawning Rules:**
- Each player receives the same number of ingredients at each spawning wave.
- At 5 seconds, each Pi receives one ingredient required for its own recipe and one randomly selected ingredient from another player's recipe.
- All nine required ingredient types must be available somewhere across the Pis by the final wave.
- Three additional ingredients are duplicates of useful recipe ingredients. No junk ingredients are spawned.
- No player can receive all three required ingredients directly from spawning.
- Ingredients appear at random positions on the screen, outside the submission zone.
- Ingredients already on the screen remain there when new ingredients spawn.
- After 10 seconds, no additional ingredients spawn, but the game continues until someone wins.

The spawning schedule is generated before each round to maintain fairness while preserving randomness.

#### Submission zone and recipe rules

Each Pi has a **center submission zone** highlighted on its plate, plus a row displaying its recipe and the ingredients already collected. When the player swipes **up**:

| Items currently in the submission zone | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| No ingredients | Nothing is submitted. |
| One correct, not-yet-submitted ingredient | Submit it and mark its recipe slot complete. |
| Two or three different correct, not-yet-submitted ingredients | **Submit all of them at once** and mark all corresponding slots complete. |
| Any wrong ingredient, or an ingredient already submitted | **Reject the whole batch**; none are consumed. |

Submitted ingredients are removed from the moving plate and remain locked in the recipe progress row. The **first player whose three required ingredients are submitted wins the round**. The winning Pi reports its completion to a designated coordinator, which announces the winner. All Pis then stop accepting moves and show the winning player and dish. If multiple wins are reported very close together, a designated game coordinator will resolve them using a consistent first-valid-completion rule.

#### Example User Experience

1. The game begins, and one ingredient spawns on each Pi.
2. Pi 1, responsible for Burger (🍞 🥩 🧀), receives 🍅 Tomato and attempts to send it to another player.
3. At 5 seconds, two additional ingredients appear on each Pi. Pi 1 receives one ingredient for Burger and one randomly selected ingredient.
4. Pi 1 moves its required ingredient into the center submission zone and swipes up to submit it.
5. At 10 seconds, one final ingredient spawns on each Pi. All required recipe ingredients are now available across the game.
6. Players continue shaking their plates and exchanging ingredients through MQTT.
7. Pi 1 eventually collects its remaining Burger ingredients and submits them.
8. If Pi 1 completes its recipe before the other players, **Pi 1 wins!** All three screens display the winner.

**Concept illustration:**

![Concept illustration: three Pi screens share ingredients through MQTT, use swipe left/right to shake, and swipe up to submit](shake_the_plate_cooperative_cooking_game.png)

*The illustration is an early design reference and still depicts a cooperative goal. The final game uses a competitive first-to-finish win condition; final Pygame graphics may differ.*

### 2. Architecture Diagram

Three Raspberry Pis form a logical ring. Each independently processes its sensor gestures, updates food positions, and renders its own display. Messages go **through the MQTT broker**, rather than a direct Pi-to-Pi network connection.

```text
                     MQTT broker
              farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883
                   /       |       \
                  /        |        \
               Pi 1      Pi 2      Pi 3
              Burger     Salad     Sushi
           APDS-9960  APDS-9960  APDS-9960
            + PiTFT    + PiTFT    + PiTFT

  Sensor input: APDS-9960 gesture on each Pi
       | 
       v
  Local computation: classify gesture, slide sprites,
                     detect edge crossings or submit-zone batch
       |                                 |
       v                                 v
  Pygame: redraw food/recipe         MQTT: send food to neighbor,
  progress, feedback, animation      receive food + acknowledgements
```

| Sender | Left-edge transfer | Right-edge transfer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi 1 | Pi 3 | Pi 2 |
| Pi 2 | Pi 1 | Pi 3 |
| Pi 3 | Pi 2 | Pi 1 |

Each Pi subscribes to the MQTT topic for its incoming food. On receipt, it inserts the ingredient into its own active plate, so **all three Pis contribute sensor-driven events and react to network messages**. We do not plan to use a separate server to run the game logic; the broker routes events and each Pi maintains its own local state.

A designated game coordinator running on one Raspberry Pi manages the synchronized game start, randomized ingredient spawning, and winner selection. Before each round, it generates a balanced spawning schedule. At 0, 5, and 10 seconds, the coordinator publishes spawn events over MQTT to the appropriate Pis. Each Pi receives these events and adds the corresponding ingredients to its local screen. Individual Pis continue to handle gesture detection, ingredient movement, and submission locally.

### 3. Build Documentation

#### Hardware and software

- **3 Raspberry Pis**, each with a PiTFT (or other compatible display).
- **3 APDS-9960 sensors**, connected through I²C/Qwiic (one per Pi).
- **Python + Pygame** to render the plate, ingredients, submission zone, recipe progress, and animations.
- **Adafruit APDS-9960 library** to read the three directional gestures.
- **Paho MQTT** to exchange ingredient-transfer events, recipe progress, and the winner announcement.
- **Pillow + Adafruit RGB Display library** to scale and display the Pygame interface on the Mini PiTFT.
- Network access to the lab's shared MQTT broker.

- The game uses two main Python files:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `shake_the_plate.py` | Main game logic, gestures, ingredient movement, MQTT communication, recipe progress, and winner detection. |
| `run_on_minitft.py` | Displays the Pygame game on the Mini PiTFT and maps the physical buttons to keyboard inputs. |

#### Running the Game on Mini PiTFT

The game is drawn at **320 × 240** in Pygame. The `run_on_minitft.py` launcher runs it without an external monitor, scales each frame to fit the **240 × 135** Mini PiTFT while preserving the aspect ratio, and outputs frames to the SPI display using the ST7789 driver. It also maps the PiTFT's physical buttons to game controls and limits display refreshes to **15 frames per second**.

**1. Prepare each Raspberry Pi**

From the `Lab 6` folder, activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/"Lab 6"
python3 -m venv .venv  # First-time setup only
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-pi.txt
pip install pygame Pillow adafruit-circuitpython-rgb-display
```

If the existing screen service occupies the Mini PiTFT, stop it first:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop piscreen.service
```

**2. Start one instance on each Pi**

Each Pi runs the same launcher, using a different required `--pi-id` argument:

| Device | Recipe | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi 1 | Burger (coordinator) | `python run_on_minitft.py --pi-id pi1` |
| Pi 2 | Salad | `python run_on_minitft.py --pi-id pi2` |
| Pi 3 | Sushi | `python run_on_minitft.py --pi-id pi3` |

All three Pis must be connected to the MQTT broker. When everyone is ready, press the **GPIO23** button on Pi 1 to start the shared round.

**3. Physical button and gesture controls**

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| GPIO23 (Space) | Start the round on Pi 1 |
| GPIO24 (Escape) | Quit the game |
| APDS-9960 swipe left | Shake ingredients left; food crossing the edge moves to the previous Pi |
| APDS-9960 swipe right | Shake ingredients right; food crossing the edge moves to the next Pi |
| APDS-9960 swipe up | Submit the valid ingredients in the center zone |

The GPIO buttons control **starting and quitting**, while the APDS-9960 gestures control gameplay.

**4. Test the game without a sensor or Mini PiTFT**

To run the regular Pygame version with simulated sensor gestures:

```bash
python shake_the_plate.py --pi-id pi1 --no-sensor
```

Use the **left**, **right**, and **up** arrow keys to simulate gestures, **Space** to start the game on Pi 1, and **Escape** to quit.

To restore the PiTFT's normal screen service afterward, if needed:

```bash
sudo systemctl start piscreen.service
```


#### MQTT topics

Use a team-specific prefix such as `IDD/shakeplate/` (change to a unique team namespace before deployment):

| Topic | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi1/food` | Ingredient transferred to Pi 1. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi2/food` | Ingredient transferred to Pi 2. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi3/food` | Ingredient transferred to Pi 3. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi1/ack` | Transfer receipt acknowledgement directed to Pi 1. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi2/ack` | Transfer receipt acknowledgement directed to Pi 2. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi3/ack` | Transfer receipt acknowledgement directed to Pi 3. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi1/progress` | Burger ingredients successfully submitted. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi2/progress` | Salad ingredients successfully submitted. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/pi3/progress` | Sushi ingredients successfully submitted. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/game/start` | Synchronize the beginning of the round. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/game/spawn` | Publish ingredient spawning events, including ingredient type, unique ID, destination Pi, and wave number. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/game/complete` | Send a recipe completion claim to the coordinator. |
| `IDD/shakeplate/game/winner` | Announce the winning player and recipe when someone finishes first. |

**Example ingredient-transfer payload:**

```json
{
  "transfer_id": "pi1-0007",
  "food_id": "tomato-01",
  "food": "tomato",
  "from": "pi1",
  "to": "pi3",
  "enter_from": "right"
}
```

Each food object has an ID to track individual ingredients. A transfer ID supports acknowledgements and duplicate detection. To prevent a dropped message from losing an ingredient, the sender marks crossing food **in transit** instead of immediately deleting it. The receiver acknowledges the ingredient; the sender then removes it from its active plate. A retried transfer should not create duplicate food.

Each Pi publishes its recipe progress. Pi 1 acts as the coordinator, receives completion claims, decides the first valid winner, and publishes one authoritative `game/winner` message so all three screens end the round consistently.

#### Game Logic (Illustrative Pseudocode)

```python
RECIPES = {
    "pi1": {"bread", "beef", "cheese"},
    "pi2": {"lettuce", "tomato", "cucumber"},
    "pi3": {"rice", "fish", "avocado"},
}

# Ingredient spawning: 3 at 0s, 6 at 5s, 3 at 10s
SPAWN_TIMES = [0, 5, 10]
SPAWN_COUNTS = [3, 6, 3]

def start_game():
    schedule = generate_balanced_spawns(RECIPES, SPAWN_COUNTS)
    publish_game_start()

    for wave, time in enumerate(SPAWN_TIMES):
        wait_until_game_time(time)
        for food in schedule[wave]:
            publish_spawn(food)


def on_spawn_received(message):
    if message["to"] == MY_PI and not already_spawned(message["food_id"]):
        add_food_at_random_position(message)
        record_spawned_id(message["food_id"])


def on_gesture(gesture):
    if gesture in ("left", "right"):
        slide_all_food(gesture)
        for food in ingredients_crossing_boundary(gesture):
            publish_transfer(neighbor_for(gesture), food)
            mark_in_transit(food)

    elif gesture == "up":
        batch = ingredients_inside_submission_zone()
        needed = RECIPES[MY_PI] - already_submitted
        types = [food["type"] for food in batch]

        if (batch and len(types) == len(set(types))
                and set(types).issubset(needed)):
            remove_from_active_plate(batch)
            already_submitted.update(types)
            publish_recipe_progress()

            if already_submitted == RECIPES[MY_PI]:
                publish_completion_claim(MY_PI)
        else:
            show_submission_rejected()


def on_food_received(message):
    if not previously_seen(message["transfer_id"]):
        add_food_at_opposite_edge(message)
        record_transfer_id(message["transfer_id"])
    acknowledge_transfer(message)

# Coordinator validates completion and publishes game/winner.
# All Pis stop accepting gestures once a winner is announced.
```

The pseudocode summarizes the main gameplay flow; the runnable implementation is in `shake_the_plate.py`. The Mini PiTFT launcher is separate and does not change the MQTT or recipe logic.

#### Game Demonstration

The following video demonstrates the complete gameplay of
**Shake the Plate!**, including gesture-based ingredient movement,
MQTT transfers between Raspberry Pis, recipe submissions,
and the winner announcement.

### 4. User Testing

We tested **Shake the Plate!** with three participants outside our team. Each participant used a Raspberry Pi equipped with a display and an APDS-9960 gesture sensor to move ingredients, transfer food between devices, and race to complete their recipe.

#### User Testing Video
The following video captures their interactions with the game,
including how they learned the gesture controls, transferred
ingredients between devices, and competed to complete
their recipes.

- **What they enjoyed:** All three participants had fun shaking the plate, exchanging ingredients, and racing to finish their recipes.
- **What they would change:** They suggested adding more ingredients and sound effects to make the game more engaging.
- **Observed problems:** Some participants initially struggled with controlling ingredient movement and accidentally transferred ingredients they needed to other players.
- **Changes made after testing:**  Based on the feedback, we increased the total number of spawned ingredients to 12 to make the game more dynamic and challenging. We also clarified the gesture instructions and adjusted ingredient movement to make the controls easier to use.
  
#### Key Takeaways
The testing showed that participants enjoyed the competitive gameplay and the interaction between multiple Raspberry Pis. MQTT enabled the three devices to function as one connected game, while the gesture-based controls made the experience interactive and playful. The feedback also highlighted opportunities to improve movement precision, provide clearer instructions, and add sound effects.


### 5. Reflection

**What worked well**: The three Raspberry Pis communicated successfully through MQTT. Ingredients moved between screens, and all three players could play together. The participants had fun shaking the plates and racing to finish their recipes.

**Challenges with distributed interaction:** We had to make sure all Pis used the same MQTT broker and topics. Small network delays sometimes made an ingredient appear a little later on another screen.

**How sensor events behaved:** The APDS-9960 detected left, right, and up gestures. Some gestures moved the ingredients farther than expected, so players needed a little practice.

**Where computation happened and why:** Each Raspberry Pi independently processed APDS-9960 gestures, updated ingredient positions, checked recipe submissions, and rendered its own game screen. Pi 1 acted as the coordinator for synchronized ingredient spawning and winner selection. The MQTT broker handled communication between devices. We distributed computation across the Pis to keep gameplay responsive and avoid relying on a central server for every movement.

**What we would improve:** We would add clearer instructions, sound effects, smoother movement, and stronger visual feedback when an ingredient is transferred or submitted. We would also make the game longer and add more recipes.
